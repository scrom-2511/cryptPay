# 🔐 Multi-Chain Crypto Wallet with QR Payments

A **multi-chain crypto wallet app** that allows users to **store, send, and pay with digital assets** across blockchains like **Solana** and **Ethereum**.  
The wallet’s highlight feature is **QR-based payments**: merchants can generate QR codes with payment details (amount, token, merchant address, order ID).  
Users scan the QR, see a **checkout page**, and approve the transaction — similar to **Google Pay**, but fully on-chain.
